  <section id="history">
    <h2>History and Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Festival of the Medina</strong> was established to honor and revive the cultural and artistic traditions of Tunisia. Held annually since the 1980s, the festival is closely tied to Ramadan, a month of spirituality and reflection. After evening prayers, the narrow alleys and courtyards of the Medina light up with performances, offering a unique blend of religion, history, and entertainment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hosting events in historic venues such as ancient mosques, traditional houses, and restored palaces, the festival showcases the Medina itself as a living museum. UNESCO recognized the Medina of Tunis as a World Heritage Site, and the festival helps keep this recognition alive by drawing attention to its cultural richness.

    <h2>What to Experience at the Festival</h2>
    <p>
      The Festival of the Medina is a true feast for the senses. Music lovers can enjoy <strong>Malouf</strong>, the classical music of Tunisia, performed with traditional instruments in intimate courtyards. International artists also participate, blending global sounds with Tunisian rhythms. Dance, theater, and storytelling sessions provide a deeper connection to local folklore and Arab culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors can attend art exhibitions, poetry readings, and film screenings spread across the Medina. The atmosphere is especially magical at night, when lanterns light up the stone walls and the aroma of traditional Ramadan food fills the streets. Each performance is designed to be family-friendly, making it a great activity for both young travelers and seasoned tourists.

    <h2>Travel Tips for Tourists</h2>
    <p>
      To make the most of your visit, plan your trip during <strong>Ramadan</strong>, as the festival dates change every year according to the Islamic calendar. Performances usually begin after sunset, so it’s wise to arrive early and explore the Medina’s souks and landmarks during the day. Many events are free or low-cost, but for special performances in historic palaces, tickets may be required in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourists should also take time to savor Tunisian cuisine at nearby restaurants offering <em>iftar</em> meals. The Medina is easily accessible from central Tunis, and guided tours are available for those who want to understand the history behind the architectural gems hosting the shows. Comfortable walking shoes are recommended, as the Medina’s cobblestone alleys can be uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are a lover of music, history, or simply looking to experience authentic Tunisian culture, the Festival of the Medina is a unique opportunity to engage with local traditions while enjoying world-class performances. It is more than a festival; it is a journey into the cultural soul of Tunisia.
